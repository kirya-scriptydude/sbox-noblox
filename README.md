Partially import .rbxl files into s&box editor.

## How To Use
**1. Acquire your .rbxl file.** Just go into Roblox Studio and save project to file.

**2. Use [RbxlRepakcer](https://github.com/kirya-scriptydude/RbxlRepacker).** It's needed due to .rbxl's compressed data. You will get .uncompressed.rbxl as a result.

**3. Choose the file and click Import.** File shouldn't necessarily be located in the project directory.

**4. Done!**
